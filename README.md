# decred-translations
This is a repository serving as a store of ideas for Decred(-related) articles to be translated into the languages of our regional communities

## The main idea

This repository was created to track articles that our writing community deems of a value high enough to warrant additional work of translating into other languages so as to broaden their reach and to attempt to reach a consensus on whether suggested articles possess the aforementioned value to the Decred Project.

## The goal

The goal here is to create a mainatained and regularly-updated list of articles to serve as an internal point of reference for Decred contributors.

## What you can do here

You can suggest articles, written by our contributors or outside authors, in English to be translated. 
The process through which to do so will, hopefully, be worked out and improved, but for now opening an issue will do.

Ideally, suggested articles should have already been discussed either in the writers room or elsewhere, but (additional) discussion is also welcome in the issues comment section.

## Selection criteria

* The initial and most obvious criterion for addition is (in my opinion) **innovation**, for lack of a better term, which means that we're looking for articles that have something new to say, or **explain an existing aspect/feature of Decred in a way that expands the knowledge base available to the average user** 

(this is very much **a work-in-progress as well as a placeholder** for more fleshed out criteria. Please feel free to suggest improvements)
