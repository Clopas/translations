# Decred Translation Status

This page tracks the status of Decred translations that require continuous maintenance, primarily **software**. For a list of completed one-off *article translations* please see [the index](index.md).

Users of this page:

- **Managers**: you can overview which translations are up-to-date, which are lagging, and who to contact to update a translation or create a new one.
- **Translators**: you can see where work is required, whether it is funded, and who to contact to get started.

Columns:

- `Release` - Last release the translation was updated for (and included in).
- `Merged` - When last translation update was merged into a release branch. `~date` means the change is UNMERGED yet.
- `Changes` - Pull requests or commits that last updated the translation.
- `Translators` - Contributors to recent translation updates.

For any questions please join the Matrix [#translations](https://chat.decred.org/#/room/#translations:decred.org) room.
