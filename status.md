# Decred Translation Status

This page tracks the status of Decred translations that require continuous maintenance, primarily **software**. [About](#about) section at the end explains how to use this page. For a list of completed one-off *article translations* please see [the index](index.md).


## Decrediton

- Decrediton translations are **funded** via the [Translations phase 3 proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/7057e0b) until 2022-12-31. Contact @kozel on Matrix for the details.
- [Translating guide](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/blob/master/app/i18n/community_translators.md), contact @matheusd on Matrix for more detais.
- Files to translate: [Basic level](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/tree/master/app/i18n/translations), [Advanced level](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/tree/master/app/i18n/docs).
- **Note**: Basic level translations use English `original.json` file which may be *outdated*! Ask repository maintainers if it's latest and safe to work with.

_Status updated: 2022-10-14_

\[1\] Last regeneration of `original.json`. "Basic" translations are based on English strings in [`original.json`](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/blob/master/app/i18n/translations/original.json). This file is not the master source of truth, it must be **regenerated** from React sources to get the latest English strings. "Advanced" translations are based on files in the [`docs`](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/tree/master/app/i18n/docs) directory and don't need the regeneration step.

## About

Users of this page:

- **Managers**: you can overview which translations are up-to-date, which are lagging, and who to contact to update a translation or create a new one.
- **Translators**: you can see where work is required, whether it is funded, and who to contact to get started.

Columns:

- `Release`
  - Earliest release the translation was updated for (and included in).
  - `UNMERGED` means it is not merged yet (waiting for a review or for the maintainer to merge).
  - `v1.7.5 TBR` means "v1.7.5 To Be Relesed", i.e. it is merged but not released yet.
  - Note that `v1.7.5` in `Release` column does *not* mean all strings in `v1.7.5` are correctly translated! It means that *some* translation made it into `v1.7.5`.
  - `m` is a short for `master`.
  - `m, v1.7.5` means a single change is in both `master` and `v1.7.5` release branch. Such translations occupy only one row in the table. If the translation was made on `master` and ported to release branch in a separate commit (or vice versa), it must be two rows in the table.
- `Merged`
  - When last translation update was merged into a release branch.
  - If `Release` column says `UNMERGED` then it is the last updated date.
- `Changes`
  - Pull requests or commits that last updated the translation (in master or release branches).
- `Translators`
  - Contributors to recent translation updates.

For any questions please join the Matrix [#translations](https://chat.decred.org/#/room/#translations:decred.org) room.
