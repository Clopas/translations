_Status updated: 2022-10-14_

- \[1\] Last regeneration of `original.json`. "Basic" translations are based on English strings in [`original.json`](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/blob/master/app/i18n/translations/original.json). This file is not the master source of truth, it must be **regenerated** from React sources to get the latest English strings. "Advanced" translations are based on files in the [`docs`](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/tree/master/app/i18n/docs) directory and don't need the regeneration step.
- \[2\] `EN base` for **Basic** translations shows the date of last regeneration of `original.json` that the translation was based on. This is the only case where intermediate files are translated instead of the master files (in Decrediton, master English strings are hard-coded in .js and .jsx files). For **Advanced** translations `EN base` is the version of [`app/i18n/docs`](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/tree/master/app/i18n/docs) files that were translated (these are master files, unlike the intermediate `original.json`).

## About

Users of this page:

- **Managers**: you can overview which translations are up-to-date, which are lagging, and who to contact to update a translation or create a new one.
- **Translators**: you can see where work is required, whether it is funded, and who to contact to get started.

Columns:

- `Release`
  - Earliest release the translation was updated for (and included in).
  - `UNMERGED` means it is not merged yet (waiting for a review or for the maintainer to merge).
  - `v1.7.5 TBR` means "v1.7.5 To Be Relesed", i.e. it is merged but not released yet.
  - Note that `v1.7.5` in `Release` column does *not* mean all strings in `v1.7.5` are correctly translated! It means that *some* translation made it into `v1.7.5`.
  - `m` is a short for `master`.
  - `m, v1.7.5` means a single change is in both `master` and `v1.7.5` release branch. Such translations occupy only one row in the table. If the translation was made on `master` and ported to release branch in a separate commit (or vice versa), it must be two rows in the table.
- `EN base`
  - Version of original English strings that was translated. It shows how possibly outdated the translation is. For example, `Language = Polish, EN base = 2022-01-01` means that Polish translation is based on English strings of 2022-01-01. If today is 2023-01-01, it means the translation may be 1 year behind the English originals (*if* English strings have changed since last translation).
- `Changes`
  - Pull requests or commits that last updated the translation (in master or release branches).
- `Translators`
  - Contributors to recent translation updates.
